# Lox interpreter & Strata UI Project Sandbox

Setting up a repo to build an interpreter with typescript
also practice some devops for work

## Task

Setup the Strata UI Platform with eslint, prettier, and jest in the repo. Create a workflow that would run all of them on pushes to main and PRs.

- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html): strongly typed javascript
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started): static analysis tool for finding and fixing problems with your code
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/motivation): fast package manager that replaces npm and yarn.
- [just](https://just.systems/man/en/): handy way to save and run project specific commands
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html): code formatter for automating consistent code style conventions
- [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started): testing framework for javascript
